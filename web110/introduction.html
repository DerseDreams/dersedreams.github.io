	<li>
	I was born in England, just outside of London, and moved to the US in 2002 with my family.
	I've lived in Charlotte for most of my life and enjoy traveling along the east coast. 
	</li>
	<li>
	I've worked in restaurants (Bistro la Bon &#38; Yama Izakaya) for the past 4 years as a server/host
	and have done an apprenticeship program with Bosch Rexroth.
	</li>
	<li>
	I graduated from Charlotte Catholic High School in 2016 and immediately started classes at CPCC that 
	summer. I then took a bit of a break from school in 2018 to focus on personal issues as well as my employment. 
	I am coming back very excited for this fall semester!
	</li>
	<li>
	I primarily use Windows 10, but have experience with Mac OS.
	</li>
	<li>
	Courses I'm Taking &#38; Why
		<ul id = "innerlist">
		<li >
		WEB 110 - I'm taking this course because I want to become proficient at creating web pages, 
		so that I can create my own profile site from scratch without having to rely on those premade website tools like Squarespace.
		</li>
		<li>
		MUS 110 - I'm taking Music Appreciation because I've played piano and clarinet for years, but haven't really been taught
		the history behind different styles of music, such as Renaissance or Opera. I'm very interested in learning about these styles.
		</li>
		<li>
		SGD 114 - I'm taking a 3D Modeling course because I'm incredibly curious about 3D printing technology and I want to be able to
		design and print something completely from scratch.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	You'll remember me from my scooter that I'll be bringing into class most days. I don't drive a car, so I have a personal electric folding scooter 
	similar to the Bird scooters. It's very efficient and is good for the environment.
	</li>
	<li>
	I'd like to include that I am gender-fluid and prefer to others to use They/Them pronouns when referring to me. I'd appreciate it!
	</li>
