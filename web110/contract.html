	Drew Allson's Course Contract
	</h1>
	<p style = "text-indent: 25px;">
		I, Drew Allson agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my (third, 2019, WEB110_01) with my instructor, DI. von Brieson.
		I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. 
		I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.

		Signed: Drew E. Allson (September 15th, 2019)

		<ul class = "imagedescript">
			<li>
			The top right contains my FTP Client that allows me to quickly update my Webspace remotely. 
			</li>
			<li>
			The bottom right window shows my File Explorer which lets me know where my files are saved and where I can access them.
			</li>
			<li>
			The bottom left is the live version of this very page, which allows me to see any changes I make to the html take effect.
			</li>
			<li>
			The top left window is Notepad++ which contains the html files for my websites, which allows me to make any edits I need to.
