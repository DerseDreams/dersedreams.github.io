	<h2>
		Website Goal
	</h2>
	<p style = "text-indent: 25px;">
		The current goal I have planned for my website will be to act as a large gallery for my favorite songs/albums along with the album covers.
		I plan to have a large grid of album covers that are hyperlinked to a larger version of the cover and give info on the song/album.
	</p>

	<h2>
		Sourcing Content
	</h2>
	<p style = "text-indent: 25px;">
		I will need to source many images as well as audio files for my site, I plan on sourcing the song/album covers from the website of the artist if it's available.
		For the audio, I will attempt to have them run through a standard audio element and use CSS to make it look sleek.
